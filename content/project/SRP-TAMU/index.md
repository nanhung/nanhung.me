Abstract:  
Environmental chemicals at Superfund sites are composed of diverse chemicals that include heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and plasticizers. Traditionally, most exposure-effect studies focus on the adverse effects of a single chemical or a mixture with few compounds. This approach might not reflect the ”real-world” exposure scenario that contains dozens or hundreds of pollutants and can cause additive or synergistic effects of human health. However, the high throughput screening-based toxicity testing provides the opportunity to examine the biological responses from complex mixtures more fully. We demonstrate that while the traditional assumptions of concentration addition or independent action are reasonable first approximations of mixture effects, in some cases, mixture bioactivity is “greater than the sum of its parts.” These results suggest that testing of actual environmental samples (e.g., real-life mixtures) is desirable. Such testing is likely only to be possible on a routine basis with in vitro models. Our research provides practical solutions for the design of future risk assessments of complex environmental samples.

# Biography

Howdy! My name is Nan-Hung Hsieh (謝男鴻). I'm a postdoc at Texas A&M University [**Toxicology Program**](https://toxicology.tamu.edu/). My research is focus on the [**pharmacokinetics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) and [**Bayesian hierarchical modeling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling), designing the mathematical model with experimental data that can be used to describe and predict the chemical (or drug) behavior in human (or experiment animal) population. 

My current research project ([**Food and Drug AdminIstration**](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U01-FD005838-01)) is to apply the [**sensitivity analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis) approach to improve the [**computer performance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance) in the Bayesian population [**physiologically based pharmacokinetic model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiologically_based_pharmacokinetic_modelling). 

I'm also the member of [**Society of Toxicology - Biological Modeling Specialty Section**](https://www.toxicology.org/groups/ss/BMSS/index.asp). A copy of my CV can be found [**HERE**](/post/CV_(NHsieh).pdf). (Latest update: Oct. 2018)

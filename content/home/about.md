# Biography

My name is Nan-Hung Hsieh (謝男鴻). I'm a postdoc at Texas A&M University [Toxicology Program](https://toxicology.tamu.edu/). My research focuses on computational toxicology and risk assessment, especially [uncertainty/variability](https://www.epa.gov/expobox/uncertainty-and-variability) and [sensitivity analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis) in Bayesian physiologically based kinetic modeling.

I'm also interested in [open science](https://opensource.com/resources/open-science) and [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). I believe that science can be more transparent, so people can easily share and acquire more knowledge through these ways. 

A copy of my CV can be found [**HERE**](/post/CV_(NHsieh).pdf). (Latest update: Dec. 2019)

# Biography

Howdy! My name is Nan-Hung Hsieh (謝男鴻). I'm a postdoc at Texas A&M University [**Toxicology Program**](https://toxicology.tamu.edu/). My research is focus on the [**pharmacokinetics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) and [**Bayesian hierarchical modeling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling), designing the mathematical model with experimental data that can be used to describe and predict the chemical (or drug) behavior in human (or experiment animal) population. I'm also the member of [**Society of Toxicology - Biological Modeling Specialty Section**](https://www.toxicology.org/groups/ss/BMSS/index.asp). 

I am now participating to [**open source**](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) / [**open science**](https://opensource.com/resources/open-science) movements. I believe that science can be more transparent and people can easily acquire more knowledge through these ways.

A copy of my CV can be found [**HERE**](/post/CV_(NHsieh).pdf). (Latest update: Jan. 2019)

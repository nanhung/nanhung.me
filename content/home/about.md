# Biography

Hi! I'm Nan-Hung Hsieh (謝男鴻). I'm a postdoc at Texas A&M University [**Toxicology Program**](https://toxicology.tamu.edu/). Currently, my research is focus on the [**pharmacokinetics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) and [**Bayesian hierarchical modeling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling), designing the mathematical model with experimental data that can be used to describe and predict the chemical (or drug) behavior in human (or experiment animal) population. 

My current research project ([**Food and Drug Adminstration**](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U01-FD005838-01)) is to apply the [**sensitivity analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis) approach to improve the [**computer performance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance) in the Bayesian population [**physiologically based pharmacokinetic model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiologically_based_pharmacokinetic_modelling). Generally, this model includes the dozens of parameters with uncertainties that posed a challenge in model calibration and validation. It can cost a lot of computational time for this complex model up to hundreds of hours. Therefore, this project aims to apply the global sensitivity analysis to find insensitive parameters, doing the parameter fixing to improve the modeling efficiency. I'm also the member of [**Society of Toxicology - Biological Modeling Specialty Section**](https://www.toxicology.org/groups/ss/BMSS/index.asp).

A copy of my CV can be found [**HERE**](/post/CV_(NHsieh).pdf). (Latest update: Mar. 2018)

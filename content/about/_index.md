Hi! I'm Nan-Hung Hsieh (謝男鴻). My research interests include

- [Dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system): To predict the temporal (time-dependent) dynamics by  mathematical model  
- [Uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification): To understand the uncertainty in the dynamical systems by statistical method

Currently, I'm a postdoc at Texas A&M University (veterinary school). I mainly focus on the [pharmacokinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) and [Bayesian hierarchical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling), designing the mathematical model with experimental data that can be used to describe and predict the chemical (or drug) behavior in human (or experiment animal) population.

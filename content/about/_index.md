Hi! I'm Nan-Hung Hsieh (謝男鴻). My research interests include

- [Dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system): To predict the temporal (time-dependent) dynamics by  mathematical model  
- [Uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification): To understand the uncertainty in the dynamical systems by statistical method

Currently, I'm a postdoc at Texas A&M University (veterinary school). I mainly focus on the [pharmacokinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) and [Bayesian hierarchical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling), designing the mathematical model with experimental data that can be used to describe and predict the chemical (or drug) behavior in human (or experiment animal) population.
My current research project is to apply the [sensitivity analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis) approach to improve the [computer performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance) in the Bayesian population [physiologically based pharmacokinetic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiologically_based_pharmacokinetic_modelling). Generally, this model includes the dozens of parameters with uncertainties that posed a challenge in model calibration and validation. It can cost a lot of computational time for this complex model up to hundreds of hours. Traditionally, the usual solution to reduce parameter dimensionality is through "expert judgment". However, it might cause lower efficiency and substantial bias in parameter estimates. Therefore, this project aims to apply the global sensitivity analysis, doing the factor fixing to improve the modeling efficiency.

Abstract:  
In this study, published toxicity bioassay of imidacloprid exposure to honey bee mortality were be used as the study data. The nonlinear regression models were used to reconstruct a dose-mortality response profiles in acute and chronic imidacloprid toxicity. We also rebuilt the differential equation-based model form previous study that can be used to simulate the seasonal dynamic of honey bee population and food storage according to the seasonality parameters of food collection, laying, and mortality rates. This study also parameterized the imidacloprid toxicity to simulate the toxicity effect to honey bee population. Finally, we applied the steady state solution of dynamic model in risk assessment framework to assess the potential risk of environmentally relevant  imidacloprid for honey bee population. We further built the interactive web application by using Shiny for the R programming language that have the potential to revolutionize the sharing and risk visualization of population dynamic model simulations. This study provide the novel risk assessment concept to characterize the imidacloprid exposure risk to honey bee population. Current result showed that realisitic in-field exposure dose distribution of imidacloprid can only effect the honey bee population slightly. Moreover, the developed population dynamic model can be further extend to simulate and realize the other risk factors that may cause colony collapse disorder. The web-based interactive applications of risk visualization can help people understand the quantitative risk of imidacloprid toxicity.

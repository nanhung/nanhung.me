I don't frequently use `git reset`. But sometime it is very useful. It just like the "SAVE and LOAD" method if you familiar with old video game :)

To revert to last version in current branch:

```
git reset --hard HEAD
```

To revert to eariler version follow this step:

```
git reset 6c5989b 
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
git commit -m "Revert to 6c5989b"
git reset --hard
git push
```
Here, `6c5986b` is the previous commit number.

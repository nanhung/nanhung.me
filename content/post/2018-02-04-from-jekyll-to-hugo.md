title: From Jekyll to Hugo

This note is inspired by the talk from **Yihui Xie** in Rstudio conference [1]. He gave the awesome show about the blogdown package. Honestly, I'm not good a good blogger. Solving the technical problem is easier than writing a blog. But I realize it is very important to write down what I learn in my programming process. Because it's very easy to forget what I learn and how I solve this problem. My previous posts really help me to save more time to find the same information in google and stack overflow. Now I switch from Jekyll to Hugo and hope this platform can help me to keep blogging. There is only one thing I need to remember in the setting (took me some time to finish it).

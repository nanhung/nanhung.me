Since there're only limited online resources that were related to [**GNU MCSim**](https://www.gnu.org/software/mcsim/), I collect some "unofficial" information in this blog post. Other great resources are in [**bug-mcsim archives**](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-mcsim/) and [**help-mcsim archives**](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-mcsim/).

This post is not about MCSim, but they discussed the differences between dynamical systems and system dynamics.

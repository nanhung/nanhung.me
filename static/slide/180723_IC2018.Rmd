# What is Pharmacokinetics (PK)

- Pharmacokinetics is the study of the fate of xenobiotics in a living organism.

- A xenobiotic is a chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced or expected to be present within the organism

HISTORY OF PHARMACOKINETICS 

Pharmacokinetics has been defined in a number of ways. Literally, the word means the
application of kinetics to pharmakon, the Greek word for drugs and poisons. Kinetics is
that branch of knowledge which involves the change of one or more variables as a
function of time.

# Pharmacokinetics Model

- Pharmacokinetic modelling is performed to .large[.bolder["predict"]] the exposure  concentration in the .bolder[concentration-time] graph by constructing the .bolder[compartmental model].

- Include indformation for <strong>dose (_D_), concentration (*C*), time (*T*), and rate constant (*k*)</strong> in simulation.

# Challenge

.large[Currently, the **Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm** is a effective way to do PBPK model calibration. ]

.xlarge[.bolder[BUT]]

--

.large[
This method often have challenges in **"convergence"** with acceptable computational times due to the need to solve system equations in PBPK model. .bolder[(More parameters, More time!)]

# What/Why Global Sensitivity Analysis?

---

class: middle

# Hypothesis

.large[
.bolder[Global Sensitivity Analysis] can provide a systematic method to ascertain which PBPK model parameters have negligible influence on model outputs and can be fixed to improve computational speed in Bayesian parameter estimation with minimal bias.

# Discussion

Can we identify “non-influential” parameters that can be fixed in a Bayesian PBPK model while achieving similar degrees of accuracy and precision?

---

# Discussion

Does fixing parameters using “expert judgment” lead to unintentional imprecision or bias?

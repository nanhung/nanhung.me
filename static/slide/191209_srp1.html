# Absorption

### Movement of chemical into the body

.font125[
- **Rate of absorption** (how quickly does it absorb?)
- **Fraction of absorption** (how percentage does it absorb?)
]

.bolder[Bioavailability] ia a key factor for substance becomes available to the target tissue after administration.

&lt;hr/&gt;

### Exposure routes

.font125[
- Inhalation – alveolar gas exchange
- Oral – gut absorption
- Dermal – permeation through skin
- Intravenous
]

.bolder[Different exposure route can related to different PK profile]

# Distribution

.font125[
- Transfer of the chemical between general circulation and tissues

- Important toxicologically because tissue concentration drives toxicity

- Factors affecting tissue distribution
  - **Blood flow** to tissues
  
- Tissue distribution (For chemicals that rapidly diffuse through membranes) 
  - Assume rapid equilibrium between blood and tissue   
  - Ratio is the tissue:blood **partition coefficient**   
    (Partition coefficient = Concentration in tissue / Concentration in blood)
  - Delivery to tissue limited by blood flow (“flow-limited”).

# Metabolism/transformation

- Enzyme systems, etc. covered in separate class.  
  - Phase I – conversion to more polar metabolite, e.g., oxidation by cytochrome P450
  - Phase II – conjugation with an endogenous substrate to increase solubility, e.g., GSH conjugation, glucuronidation

- Key issues relevant to risk assessment
  - What are the metabolites?  
  - In what tissues does metabolism occur?
  - What are the rates of metabolism?  
  - What is known about interspecies and intraspecies differences?

- **Metabolism process**
  - **First order kinetics** (linear; constant)
  - **Michaelis-Menten Kinetics** (Non-linear; concentration dependent)

# Metabolism - Acetaminophen

.center[![](https://image.ibb.co/e7eccz/JjqgWwg.gif)]

.font125[
- Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used pain reliver and fever reducer.
- The therapeutic index (ratio of toxic to therapeutic doses) is unusually small.
- .bolder[Phase I] (APAP to NAPQI) is toxicity pathway at high dose.
- .bolder[Phase II] (APAP to APAP-Glucuronidation &amp; APAP to APAP-Sulfation) is major pathways at therapeutic dose.

# Excretion

## Excretion is the removal from the body

.font125[
- Urine
- Exhalation
- Feces
- Minor pathways: sweat, saliva, milk
]

&lt;/br&gt;

.bolder[Excretion and elimination are often confused]
- Excretion is reserved for exiting the body
- Elimination is the disappearance of a chemical, including both excretion and metabolism

# Elimination kinetics

.pull-left[
### Zero-order kinetics 

The elimination is **independent** with internal chemical dose

&lt;/br&gt;

### First-order kinetics

The elimination is **dependent** with internal chemical dose

.font125[
.pull-left[
**Numerical**

- Use the differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those functions.

# Physiological-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK)

Mathematically transcribing .bolder[anatomical, physiological, physical, and chemical] descriptions of the phenomena involved in the complex .bolder[ADME] processes.

.center[![:scale 60%](http://pharmguse.net/pkdm/pbpm.jpg)]

---

# Why PBPK models?

- There are some processes that empirical models have difficulty simulating – such as inhalation exposures.

- We know a lot about the physiology/anatomy of the organisms we study and want to protect.
  - Organ/tissue sizes
  - Connections between organs/tissues
  - Blood flow rates
  - Ventilation rates
  - Metabolizing enzymes
  - Etc…

By developing a model, we can incorporate that information to help us make inferences beyond the experimental data at hand.

---

# Building a PBPK model

- Decide on what compartments are needed
  - Target vs. non-target tissues
  - Tissues with in vivo vs. in vitro vs. no data
  - Exposure routes

- Specify the (interrelated) equations for each compartment

- Specify parameter values
  - Physiological/anatomical parameters
  - Chemical-specific parameters

- Set up the inputs (doses, exposure concentrations, etc.) and outputs (blood, tissue, exhaled breath concentrations).

- Solve using numerical differential equation solver and compare with data

&lt;/br&gt;

# Compartmental equations

- Flow in and out of “storage” compartments involve only blood flow

- Key parameters/variables
    
    `\(Q_i\)` = tissue blood flow

    `\(P_i\)` = tissue-blood partition coefficient

    `\(V_i\)` = volume of tissue

    `\(C_a\)` = arterial blood concentration

    `\(CV_i\)` = venous blood concentration leaving tissue

    `\(A_i\)` = amount in tissue

    `\(C_i\)` = concentration in tissue

# Basic transport equations

The model equations follow the principles of mass transport, fluid dynamics, and biochemistry in order to simulate the fate of a substance in the body.

rate in `\(= Q_iC_{art}\)`  &amp;  rate out `\(= Q_iC_{VT} = Q_i \cdot C_i/P_i\)` (Unit: mass/time)

Change in amount = rate in – rate out

.font125[
`$$\frac{d A_{i}}{d t}=Q_{i}\left(C_{a r t}-\frac{A_{i}}{P_{i} V_{i}}\right)$$`

or

`$$\frac{d C{i}}{d t}=\frac{Q_{i}}{V_i}\left(C_{a r t}-\frac{C_{i}}{P_{i} V_{i}}\right)$$`
]

`\(A_i\)` is amount of chemical, `\(Q_i\)` is blood flow, `\(C_{art}\)` incoming arterial blood concentration, `\(P_i\)` the tissue over blood partition coefficient, and `\(V_i\)` the volume of compartment `\(i\)`.

# GNU MCSim

.font75[

- The project started by Don Maszle and [Frederic Y. Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Y._Bois) in UC Berkeley, 1991. It is written in standard C language as a model preprocessor. 
- First public release in 1993 (straight simulations with Monte Carlo modeling).

&gt; GNU MCSim is a general purpose modeling and simulation program which can performs "standard" or "Markov chain" Monte Carlo simulations. It allows you to specify a set of **linear or nonlinear algebraic equations** or **ordinary differential equations**. They are solved numerically using parameter values you choose or parameter values sampled from statistical distributions. Simulation outputs can be compared to experimental data for Bayesian parameter estimation (model calibration).

# GNU MCSim Overview

The *GNU MCSim* consists in two pieces, a **model generator** and a **simulation engine**:

&lt;hr&gt;

The model generator, **"mod"**

- Created to facilitate structural model definition and maintenance, while keeping execution time short. You can code your model using a simplified syntax and use mod to translate it to `C` (`model.c`).


The simulation engine, **"sim"**

- A set of routines which are linked to your model during compilation to produce executable program (`mcsim.model`). After that, you can run simulations of your model under a variety of conditions, specify an associated statistical model, and perform simulations.

# Types of Simulation

**Simple simulation**  
- Straight simulations (set parameter values and initial conditions).

**Used to:** *Model testing when building the model (e.g., mass balance)*

&lt;hr&gt;

**Monte Carlo simulations**  
- Perform repeated (stochastic) simulations across a randomly sampled region of the model parameter space.

**Used to:** *Check possible simulation (under given parameter distributions) results before model calibration*

&lt;hr&gt;

**SetPoints simulation**   
- Solves the model for a series of specified parameter sets. You can create these parameter sets yourself or use the output of a previous Monte Carlo or MCMC simulation.

**Used to:** *Posterior analysis, Local/global sensitivity analysis*

# Types of Simulation

### Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
- Performs a series of simulations along a Markov chain in the model parameter space. 
- They can be used to obtain the Bayesian &lt;font color="red"&gt;**posterior**&lt;/font&gt; distribution of the model parameters, given a statistical model, &lt;font color="blue"&gt;**prior**&lt;/font&gt; parameter distributions and data for which a **likelihood function** can be computed. 
- *GNU MCSim* can handle hierarchical statistical models as well.

# Summary

- Basic pharmacokinetics  
  - **A,D,M,E** each may affect internal dose, and differences between species or among individuals.

- Role of pharmacokinetics in risk assessment 
  - Exposure / concentration **prediction**

- Pharmacokinetic modelling  
  - Information from **physiology** and **chemistry** are common ways to characterize the concentration-time relationship.

- Computational toolkits  
  - The **open soure** computational tools (e.g., R &amp; GNU MCSim) are powerful and can help us conduct the model simulation and data analysis

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 1: **Exploratory analysis of PK data**

- Now, we have a theophylline PK dataset. The purpose of this exercise is to develop the simple PK model and use it to describe the PK of theophylline. First, look into the theophylline dataset. The `Theoph` data frame has 132 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. Then, find the Cmax and Tmax for each individual. 


```r
head(Theoph)
```

```
##   Subject   Wt Dose Time  conc
## 1       1 79.6 4.02 0.00  0.74
## 2       1 79.6 4.02 0.25  2.84
## 3       1 79.6 4.02 0.57  6.57
## 4       1 79.6 4.02 1.12 10.50
## 5       1 79.6 4.02 2.02  9.66
## 6       1 79.6 4.02 3.82  8.58
```

- Plot the pharmacokinetic diagram for each individual.

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 2: **PK model development**

- Develop the non compartment model and compartment model in R and MCSim


- Non compartment model

`$$C(t) = \frac{F\cdot D \cdot ka}{V(k_a - k_e)}\cdot(\mathrm{e}^{-k_et}-\mathrm{e}^{-k_a{t}})$$`

- Compartment model

`$$\frac{dA_{gut}}{dt}=-k_aA_{gut}$$`

`$$\frac{dA}{dt}=k_aA_{gut}-k_eA_e$$`
`$$C=A/V$$`

---

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 3: **Parameter setting and simulation**

- Extract the chemical information from httk package
```r
library(httk)
parms &lt;- httk::parameterize_1comp(chem.name = "theophylline")
```

- Use the parameters in the developed model and conduct the simulation 
- Compare the difference between data and the model simulation result (Cmax, Tmax)

---

# Hands on Exercise

## Task 4: **PBPK model development**

- Instead of simple PK model, in this exercise we want to apply the well developed PBPK model for 1,3 butadiene.

- First, reproduce the simulation result from the published paper*.

- **Example: Ethylbenzene PBPK model**

## 3. Population modeling

???

In this tutorial, we will focus on MCMC calibration. Which means we want to calibrate the model parameters and find the likelihood of the model parameter to fit the data.

I will start by introducing the MCMC principle. What is Bayesian? What is MCMC? How do we apply this technique in our modeling process? Also, I will summarise the overall workflow include the content in our previous tutorials. And, I will use the linear model as an example to explain the basic knowledge in MCMC calibration.

The second section is to explain how to use mCSim to Run MCMC simulation and use R to analyze and visualize the model output. We will go through the Ethylbenzene PBPK model as an example to demo the full workflow from model verification, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis and finally demonstrate the MCMC calibration in this case.

After the ethylbenzene PBPK model, I'll use the tetrachloroethylene PBPK model to explain how to apply the hierarchical approach to calibrate the parameter in population and individual levels.

# General workflow

### 1 Model constructing or translating

### 2 Verify modeling result

- **Compare with published result**
- **Mass balance** 

### 3 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis

- **Monte Carlo simulation**
- **Morris elementary effects screening** 
- **Fourier amplitude sensitivity test**

### 4 Model calibration 

- **Markov chain Monte Carlo** 
  - Diagnostics (Goodness-of-fit, convergence)

???

Here is the review of the general workflow in our modeling process. In the first tutorial, I explain the basic knowledge in PK modeling. We can translate the model code from other programming language to MCSim and conduct the straight forward simulation. We had some exercise to run the model and verify the modeling result through comparing the published data. 

Then, in the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, we can apply Monte Carlo simulation with the given distribution of model parameter to exam whether the experiment data can be covered in uncertainty or the distribution of model output.

If our data can not cover in the range of our simulation, we might need to figure out which parameters had significant impact on the model output. 
So through Morris elementary effects screening we can find the influential parameter for specific varibale in our model than we can adjust the parameter range to have better prediction. 

In addtion, if we have too many parameters that might cause the computational burden in MCMC calibration, we might need to apply the global sensitivity approach to detect the noninfluential parameter and fix this parameter at baseline value.

Finally, we can us MCMC algorithm to do model calibration. This is the today's topic as well.

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo

### - Iterative update the probability distribution, if the new proposed distribution is accepted.

# Bayes' rule

.font200[
$$ p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(\theta) p(y|\theta) }{p(y)}$$
]

$\theta$: **Observed or unobserved parameter**

$y$: **Observed data**

</br>

$p(\theta)$: *Prior distribution* of model parameter

$p(y|\theta)$: *Sampling distribution* of the experiment data given by a parameter vector

$p(y)$: *Likelihood* of data

$p(\theta|y)$: *Posterior distribution*

???

The MCMC is based on the Bayesian rule. In this function, it includes the density of observed or unobserved parameter that is often referred to as the prior distribution in our model, which is p(theta). 

Also, we have the sampling distribution (or data distribution), which is p(y|theta). This term is used to explain the probability of the observed result that is given by the model parameter.

Then, we need to have the likelihood to describe the probability distribution of the experiment data (y). And through this information, the posterior can be estimated by this equation.

# Monty Hall Problem

> Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you, ”Do you want to pick door number 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?

The famous example of Bayesian rule in real life is the Monty Hall problem. 

Suppose there is a game show, the contestant has a chance to win a car that is behind the one of three-door, so the probability of winning the car is one-third. But the host gives the contestant the information, he opens the door that is a goat behind this door and asks contest to switch from the chosen door or not. 

At this time, in this case, the question is changed to what is the probability of winning the car if the contestant switches the choice. It's not the 50/50 probability. 

The diagram here explains the conditional probability of winning by switching the door. If contestant switches the door, it will have 67% probability to win the game compared with 33% if staying with the original choice.

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo

.font120[
- **Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm**
]

The algorithm was named for Nicholas Metropolis (physicist) and Wilfred Keith Hastings (statistician). The algorithm proceeds as follows.

**Initialize**

1. Pick an initial parameter sets $\theta_{t=0} = \{\theta_1, \theta_2, ... \theta_n\}$

**Iterate**

1. *Generate*: randomly generate a candidate parameter state $\theta^\prime$ for the next sample by picking from the conditional distribution  $J(\theta^\prime|\theta_t)$
2. *Compute*:  compute the acceptance probability 
$A\left(\theta^{\prime}, \theta_{t}\right)=\min \left(1, \frac{P\left(\theta^{\prime}|y\right)}{P\left(\theta_{t}|y\right)} \frac{J\left(\theta_{t} | \theta^{\prime}\right)}{J\left(\theta^{\prime} | \theta_{t}\right)}\right)$
2. *Accept or Reject*:
  1. generate a uniform random number $u \in[0,1]$
  2. if $u \leq A\left(x^{\prime}, x_{t}\right)$ accept the new state and set $\theta_{t+1}=\theta^{\prime}$, otherwise reject the new state, and copy the old state forward $\theta_{t+1}=\theta_{t}$

???

Markov chain Monte Carlo is a general method based on drawing values of parameter theta from approximate distributions and then correcting those draws to better approximate target posterior p(theta|y). 

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a general term for a family of Markov chain simulation methods that are useful for drawing samples from Bayesian posterior distribution. The Metropolis algorithm is an adaption of a random walk that uses an acceptance/rejection rule to the target distribution. 

In the beginning, it draws a starting point for the initial parameter sets based on the given prior parameter setting. Then, sample the candidate parameter state from a jumping distribution, which is J of theta prime given theta t. 
The second step is to compute the acceptance probability from the ratio of posterior and jumping distribution.

Finally, it uses the acceptance probability and compares with the random number that generates from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 to determine the proposed parameter vector can be kept or discard in the next iteration.

A Markov Chain is a random process that has the property that the future depends only on the current state of the process and not the past. So, it is memoryless. Imagine somebody who is drunk and can move only one pace at a time. The drunk moves with equal probability. This is a Markov Chain where the drunk's future or next position depends only upon where he is at present.

???

In the MCMC process, the pupose is not to estimate the maximun likelihood, but it attemp to continuous construct the probability of the parameter estimation. The posterior in the current iteration will become the prior of next iteration.

# log-likelihood

The log-likelihood function was used to assess the **goodness-of-fit** of the model to the data ([Woodruff and Bois, 1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378427493901035?via%3Dihub), [Hsieh et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00588/full#B43))

$$L L=\sum_{i=1}^{N}-\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\left(y_{i}-\widehat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}}{S_{j[i]}^{2}}-\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(2 \pi s_{j[i]}^{2}\right)$$

$N$: the total number of the data points 

$y_i$: experimental observed

$\hat{y}_i$: model predicted value

$j[i]$: data type (output variable) of data point $i$

$S_{j[i]}^{2}$: the variance for data type $j$

???

There is a log-likelihood function that can be used to estimate the goodness-of-fit. This function used the information include ... to estimate log-likelihood. In our study, we used this function to assess the model performance when we apply parameter fixing. The log-likelihood of data can also estimate in MCSim in each iteration.

# Calibration & evaluation

### Prepare model and input files 
  - Need at least 4 chains in simulation

### Check convergence & graph the output result

.font120[
  - **Parameter**, **log-likelihood of data**
  - Trace plot, density plot, correlation matrix, auto-correlation, rank histogram, ...
  - Gelman–Rubin convergence diagnostics (potential scale reduction factor, $\hat{R}$)
]

### Evaluate the model fit
  - Global evaluation (all output variables, $y_{i,t}$)
  - Individual evaluation 

???

In the model calibration and evaluation process, we need at least four chains to check how good of the convergence of the model parameter sacross these four simulations. Ideally, the posterior should be well-mixing and not easy to distinguish the difference.

There are several methods to check the convergence include trace plot, density plot, correlation matrix, auto-correlation, rank histogram, etc. 
The most widely-used convergence diagnostic is the potential scale reduction factor, which was published by Gelman and Rubin in 1992.

After the convergence diagnosis, we can evaluate the model fit through the global method. The MCSim also provide a simple way to quickly check the result through this way. In addition, we can check the individual time-concentration profile and evaluate the model performance.

# Final thoughts

MCMC simulation is a computational intensive process for metamodel or big data, one of the important issue today is how to improve the efficiency in the modeling.

- If possible, remove or turn-off unnecessary state variable (e.g., mass balance, metabolites). 

- Re-parameterization ([Chiu et al., 2006](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-006-0061-9))

- Global sensitivity analysis and parameter fixing ([Hsieh et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00588/full))

- Parallel computing

- Grouped data

- Algorithm

- Software, hardware, ...
